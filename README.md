lol-jclient
===========

a Java implementation of the League of Legends PVP.net Client.


*Goal: Create a Java implementation of the League of Legends PVP.net Client.*

###Why create an alternative client to the PVP.net client?
I decided to make one because I was fed up by the multitude of bugs in the official client. Hopefully lol-jclient will provide a bug-free version with more frequent updates.

Todo - write of a lot of stuff that was posted by me from [the introduction reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1lnb1f/introducing_loljclient_the_java_pvpnet_client/)
